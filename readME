what is a template inheritance??
u create a master html file which is the  skeleton of what every page should look like. u just inherit that in other age and insert code where u need it. 


This is JINJA 2 syntax. this the template engine flask uses. So, we are creating a block and template and this block is where we are going to insert our code where all other pages pages that inherit this template
{% block head %}{% endblock %}

Never write this statements with {{}} or {%%} inside html and comment them
{{}} is used for printing and declaring stuff where as {%%} is used for for loops, if statements and all
